/// `CoachAllTeamsView` is a SwiftUI view that displays a list of all teams that a coach manages. It allows the coach to:
/// - View the list of teams they are associated with.
/// - Navigate to a detailed view of each team (via `CoachMyTeamView`).
/// - Create a new team by tapping the "Add +" button, which opens a modal sheet for creating a new team.
///
/// ### Key Features:
/// 1. **List of Teams**: Displays a list of all teams the coach is managing, fetched asynchronously via the `TeamModel`.
///    - If there are no teams, it shows a message: "No teams found."
/// 2. **Create Team**: The coach can create a new team by tapping the "Add +" button in the navigation bar. This opens a sheet (`CoachCreateTeamView`) for team creation.
/// 3. **Team Navigation**: Each team in the list is clickable. Tapping a team navigates to the `CoachMyTeamView`, where the coach can view or edit team details.
/// 4. **Data Handling**: The list of teams is fetched asynchronously on view load using the `teamModel.loadAllTeams()` method, and the view is refreshed after creating a new team.
///
/// ### Data Flow:
/// - The `teams` state variable holds the list of teams fetched asynchronously when the view appears.
/// - A `Button` allows the coach to toggle the visibility of a sheet to create a new team. Upon dismissal, the team list is refreshed.
///
/// ### Use Case:
/// - This view is typically used in the profile section of a coach's dashboard, allowing them to manage their teams in an organized manner.
/// - Coaches can manage multiple teams and quickly navigate to a specific team's details.
