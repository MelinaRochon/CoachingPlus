/// `PlayerAllTeamsView` is a SwiftUI view that displays a list of teams a player is associated with.
/// This view also provides functionality for the player to enter a "group code" to join a new team.
///
/// ### Key Features:
/// 1. **List of Teams**: Displays the player's current teams in a list. If no teams are found, a message "No teams found." is shown.
///    - Each team in the list is tappable and navigates to `PlayerMyTeamView` where the player can interact with the team's details.
/// 2. **Group Code for Joining Teams**: The player can enter a group code to join a new team. When the user taps "Enter Code", a text field appears where the player can enter the group code.
///    - If the group code is valid, the player is added to the team. Otherwise, an error message is shown.
/// 3. **Error Handling**: If the group code is invalid or there is an error when adding the player to the team, error alerts are displayed.
struct PlayerAllTeamsView: View {
    
    /// Controls the visibility of the text field for entering the group code
    /// This state variable determines whether the user should see the input field
    /// for entering a team access code or not.
    @State private var showTextField = false

    /// Stores the group code entered by the player
    /// This is a temporary variable that holds the code entered by the player
    /// to join a new team. It is submitted when the player clicks the "Submit" button.
    @State private var groupCode: String = ""

    /// Tracks whether the initial view (the "Have a Group Code?" text and the "Enter Code" button) should be shown
    /// This is used to toggle between the initial "Have a Group Code?" message and the input field for the code.
    /// When the player decides to enter a code, this view will hide and show the code entry field instead.
    @State private var showInitialView = true

    /// A state object that holds the team model, which handles team-related data and logic
    /// This object is used to fetch the list of teams, validate access codes, and add the player to a team.
    @StateObject private var teamModel = TeamModel()

    /// Holds the list of teams that the player is currently part of
    /// This state variable stores the teams fetched from the backend or database. It is updated when the data is loaded.

    /// Controls whether an alert should be shown when an invalid access code is entered
    /// This state variable is triggered if the player submits a group code that doesn't match any team.
    @State private var showErrorAccessCode: Bool = false

    /// Controls whether an error alert should be shown if there is an issue adding the player to the team
    /// If an error occurs when trying to add the player to the team, this flag will display a related alert.
