/**
 This view is responsible for displaying the details of the selected team, including all recorded game footage and players related to that team.

 Key responsibilities:
 - Displays a list of games that the team has participated in, including their titles and start times.
 - Allows the user (typically a coach) to access a detailed view of each game's footage by navigating to the `PlayerSpecificFootageView`.
 - Displays a button in the toolbar for accessing the team's settings, where the coach can modify team-related information.
 - Handles the refresh of game and player data when the view appears, ensuring that the list of games and players is up to date.
 - Provides a mechanism for adding players to the team if the team is missing any players, including showing a message if there are no players or invited players available.
 - The view supports different modes depending on the user's role (e.g., coach or player).

 The view is structured to allow easy navigation between games, display key information about the games (such as game titles, start times, and game status), and provide settings to manage the team’s players.
 
 **Functions:**
 - `refreshData()`: Fetches the latest game and player data for the selected team. It loads all games associated with the team and fetches the players and invited players from the team’s data model.
 - `onAppear`: The view fetches the data whenever the view appears on the screen to ensure it is up-to-date.
 
 This view is specifically designed for coaches to manage and view team-related data, such as game schedules and player information. It also allows coaches to modify team settings and manage their players in a structured and intuitive way.
