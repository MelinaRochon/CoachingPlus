/***
 * This structure represents the coach's profile page.
 * It allows the coach to view and edit their profile information, including their name, email, phone number,
 * country, and other personal details. It also includes options for the coach to log out, reset their password,
 * and upload or modify their profile picture.
 *
 * ## Key Features:
 * - **Profile Picture**: Displays the coach's profile picture, which can be edited by tapping on it.
 *   If no picture is selected, a default system icon is shown.
 * - **Profile Information**: Displays the coach's name, email, phone number, country, and membership details.
 *   If the coach is in editing mode, these fields become editable.
 * - **Edit Mode**: The coach can toggle between viewing and editing mode. In editing mode, they can update
 *   their phone number and other details.
 * - **Buttons**: There are buttons to log out, reset the password, and save changes to the profile.
 *
 * ## View Structure:
 * - **Navigation View**: The root container for navigation in this profile page.
 * - **Profile Picture & Details**: Displays the coach's profile picture (or default icon) and their name, email, and user type.
 *   This section becomes editable when `isEditing` is true.
 * - **Profile Information List**: Displays the coach's personal details like date of birth, phone number, country, and membership details.
 *   The fields are displayed in a `List` where the values can be edited in `isEditing` mode.
 * - **Reset Password and Log Out**: If the coach is not editing their profile, buttons for resetting the password and logging out are shown.
 *
 * ## Fetching and Updating Data:
 * - The `viewModel.loadCurrentUser()` function is called when the view appears to load the current coach's data.
 * - If changes are made in the profile (e.g., phone number), the `viewModel.updateCoachInformation()` function is used to save the updates to the database.
 *
 * ## Usage:
 * - This view is used as the coach's profile page within the app, allowing them to manage their personal information and account settings.
