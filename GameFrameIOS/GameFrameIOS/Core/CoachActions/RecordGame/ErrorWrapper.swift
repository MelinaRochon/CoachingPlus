/**This file defines a structure called `ErrorWrapper`, which is used to wrap an error along
  with additional guidance to provide context or instructions related to the error.
  It is useful in handling errors with meaningful explanations or steps for resolution.

  ## Purpose:
  The `ErrorWrapper` structure is designed to be used when an error needs to be reported
  alongside contextual guidance that helps users or developers understand how to address the
  issue. It can be useful for UI alerts or logging, where providing actionable feedback
  to the user is important.

  ## Key Features:
  - Wraps an `Error` with an `id` for unique identification.
  - Includes a `guidance` string that provides instructions or suggestions related to the error.

  - `error`: The actual error that occurred.
  - `guidance`: A string providing contextual guidance or instructions to address the error.
