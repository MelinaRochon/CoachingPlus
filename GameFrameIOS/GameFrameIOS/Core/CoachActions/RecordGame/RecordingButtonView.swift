/** This file defines a custom SwiftUI view called `RecordingButtonView` that represents a button
  used for starting and stopping audio recordings. The button has a dynamic appearance, changing
  shape and size based on the recording state (i.e., recording or not recording).

  ## Purpose:
  The `RecordingButtonView` is used in the UI to provide an interactive button that allows
  users to toggle audio recording. The button provides visual feedback when recording starts
  and stops, using animations to make the user experience more intuitive and engaging.

  ## Key Features:
  - The button's appearance changes when recording starts or stops (size, shape, color).
  - Pulsing animation effect to visually indicate the recording state.
  - Callback function (`onRecordingStateChange`) to notify the parent view of the recording state.
**Note**: This is the audio recording button view
