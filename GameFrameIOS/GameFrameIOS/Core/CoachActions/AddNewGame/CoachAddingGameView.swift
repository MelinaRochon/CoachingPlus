/**
 `CoachAddingGameView` is a SwiftUI view that allows soccer coaches to create a new game event.
 
 ## Features:
 - **Game Details:** Input a title, select a team, and specify the location.
 - **Scheduled Time:** Choose a start time and set a game duration.
 - **Feedback Settings:** Configure automatic feedback reminders before and after key events.
 - **Recording Reminder:** Enable or disable recording notifications before the game.
 - **Firestore Integration:** Saves the created game event to the Firebase Firestore database.
 
 This view interacts with `AddNewGameModel`, which handles data storage, team retrieval, and database operations.
 It includes form-based inputs and custom pickers for a streamlined user experience.
 
 ## Navigation:
 - **Back to Teams Page:** Users can dismiss the view with a cancel button.
 - **Save and Proceed:** Users can finalize game details and save them to the database.
 
 This view is designed with state management using `@StateObject` for handling game data and `@Environment(\.dismiss)`
 for navigation control.
