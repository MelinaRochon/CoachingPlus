/**
 This file contains the `CoachAddPlayersView` structure, which provides a form for coaches to add a new player to a team.
 The view allows coaches to input essential player information such as first name, last name, email, nickname, jersey number,
 and guardian details like name, email, and phone number.

 The form also validates inputs and ensures that certain fields, such as the player's name and email, are filled in
 before the "Add" button is enabled. Upon submission, the player is added to the team, and the view is dismissed.
 
 This file also contains a utility function to format phone numbers as they are entered by the user.
