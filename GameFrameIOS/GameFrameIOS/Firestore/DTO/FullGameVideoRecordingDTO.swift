/// `FullGameVideoRecordingDTO` is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents the information associated with a full game video recording.
/// This structure is used to transfer video recording data between the app and the backend or server, including details about the game, the team, and the video itself.
///
/// ### Properties:
/// - `gameId`: A unique identifier for the game that the video recording is associated with. This helps to link the video to a specific game.
/// - `uploadedBy`: The user who uploaded the video recording (e.g., coach, player, or admin). This property identifies the source of the video upload.
/// - `fileURL`: A string representing the URL or path to the video file. This points to the location of the video on the server or cloud storage.
/// - `startTime`: A `Date` object representing the timestamp when the video recording started. This is used to track the beginning of the video recording.
/// - `endTime`: An optional `Date` object representing the timestamp when the video recording ended. This marks the end of the video and is useful for defining the length of the recording.
/// - `teamId`: A unique identifier for the team associated with the game. This helps link the video to a specific team participating in the game.
