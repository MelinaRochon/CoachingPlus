/// `CommentDTO` is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents a comment associated with a specific key moment or transcript within a game.
/// This structure is used to transfer comment data between the app and the backend or server.
///
/// ### Properties:
/// - `keyMomentId`: A unique identifier for the key moment that the comment is associated with. This links the comment to a specific key moment in the game.
/// - `gameId`: A unique identifier for the game where the comment was made. This property helps link the comment to the corresponding game.
/// - `transcriptId`: A unique identifier for the transcript that the comment is related to. This property connects the comment to the relevant transcript.
/// - `uploadedBy`: The user (coach, player, etc.) who uploaded the comment. This is typically the ID of the user who created the comment.
/// - `comment`: The text content of the comment itself. This is the actual comment made by the user (e.g., feedback, notes, or observations).
/// - `createdAt`: The date and time when the comment was created. This helps track when the comment was posted and could be used for sorting or filtering comments by date.
