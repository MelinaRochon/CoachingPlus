/// Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing a player in the system. This struct encapsulates essential details about a player, including personal information,
/// team enrollments, and guardian information (for minors). It is primarily used for organizing and transferring player-related data within the application.
///
/// The `PlayerDTO` struct is flexible enough to accommodate both adult players and minors. For minor players, guardian details (e.g., name, email, and phone) can
/// be stored as optional fields. The struct allows for easy management of player profiles, including personal identifiers, team participation, and contact details.
///
/// ### Properties:
/// - `playerId`: A unique identifier for the player, typically assigned by the system. It is optional as not all player records might have it at creation.
/// - `jerseyNum`: The player's jersey number. It is a required field, as it uniquely identifies a player within a team.
/// - `nickName`: An optional string for storing the player's nickname, if applicable.
/// - `gender`: An optional string indicating the player's gender, useful for categorizing players in gender-specific teams or competitions.
/// - `profilePicture`: An optional string that can store a URL or path to the player's profile picture.
/// - `teamsEnrolled`: A list of team identifiers (strings) that the player is enrolled in. This is a required field, as it links the player to the teams they are part of.
/// - `guardianName`: An optional string to store the name of the player's guardian (for minors).
/// - `guardianEmail`: An optional string to store the guardian's email address.
/// - `guardianPhone`: An optional string to store the guardian's phone number.
