/**
 This struct represents a game in the Firestore database. It includes details such as the game's title, duration,
 location, time-related settings (such as scheduled time reminder and feedback times), and other metadata like the
 team ID associated with the game. The struct is `Codable`, making it easy to serialize and deserialize between
 Firestore documents and the application's data model.

 Properties:
 - `gameId`: A unique identifier for the game document in Firestore.
 - `title`: The title or name of the game.
 - `duration`: The duration of the game in seconds.
 - `location`: The location where the game is scheduled to take place. This is optional.
 - `scheduledTimeReminder`: A reminder time for the game in minutes. This indicates how far in advance the reminder
   should trigger before the game starts.
 - `startTime`: The scheduled start time of the game. This is optional and may be nil if not set.
 - `timeBeforeFeedback`: The time, in seconds, before feedback can be provided during the game.
 - `timeAfterFeedback`: The time, in seconds, after feedback can be provided.
 - `recordingReminder`: A boolean indicating whether a reminder for recording is enabled for the game.
 - `teamId`: The ID of the team associated with this game.

 The struct has several initializers:
 - A default initializer that takes in all the necessary game properties.
 - A convenience initializer that creates a game with default values if the data is unavailable.
 - An initializer that maps data from a `GameDTO` (Data Transfer Object), which is commonly used when receiving
   game data from an external source like an API.

 The struct is also `Codable` to work with Firestore's data serialization and deserialization features. It includes
 custom `init(from:)` and `encode(to:)` methods for decoding and encoding the game data.

 This model is used to store and retrieve game data from the Firestore database.

/**
 The `GameManager` class is responsible for managing game-related operations in the Firestore database. It provides
 methods to add, update, retrieve, and manage games for a specific team. This class uses Firestore's `DocumentReference`
 and `CollectionReference` to interact with the database.

 Key responsibilities of the `GameManager` class include:
 - Retrieving specific game documents and collections.
 - Fetching all games for a specific team.
 - Adding new games to the Firestore database.
 - Updating existing games (e.g., updating game duration).
 
 The class follows the Singleton design pattern, which means there is only one instance of this class in the application.
 The singleton instance can be accessed via the `shared` static property.

 This class acts as a centralized manager for game-related database operations, ensuring that the app can seamlessly
 retrieve and modify game data for specific teams.
