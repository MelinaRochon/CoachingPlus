// MARK: - File description

 /** This file defines the `PlayerProtocol` that enforces the validation requirement
  for adding a player to a team. Any view or model that handles player data and
  is responsible for adding players to a team must conform to this protocol.
  The protocol ensures that player data is validated before any addition to a team,
  providing a consistent interface for validation across different views and models.

  ### Features:
  - Contains a computed property `addPlayerToTeamIsValid` to validate player data,
    ensuring the necessary fields are filled in correctly.
